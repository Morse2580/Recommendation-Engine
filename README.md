## Movie Recommendation Engine using TF-IDF and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive guide and codebase to create a movie recommendation engine using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 
This engine will suggest movies to users based on their historical preferences and similarities between movies.

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset: Read your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and any other data quality issues.

Feature Engineering: Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and the values are user ratings or interactions.

#### Step 2: TF-IDF Vectorization
Text Preprocessing (Optional): If your dataset contains textual information about movies (e.g., movie descriptions), perform text preprocessing like lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stopwords.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Use the TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn to convert textual information into numerical TF-IDF vectors.

#### Step 3: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model Training: Train a KNN model on the TF-IDF vectors. You can use the KNeighborsClassifier or NearestNeighbors from Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation (Optional): If you have historical ratings, you can evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#### Step 4: Making Recommendations
Input User Preferences: Collect user preferences or their past interactions with movies.

Vectorize User Input: Use the same TF-IDF vectorizer to convert user preferences into TF-IDF vectors.

Find Similar Movies: Use the KNN model to find k-nearest neighbors (similar movies) based on the user's input.

Recommend Movies: Recommend the top-rated movies among the k-nearest neighbors as user recommendations.

#### Step 5: Deployment
You can deploy this recommendation engine in various ways, such as a web application, mobile app, or as part of an existing platform. Popular web frameworks like Flask or Django can be used for this purpose.

#### Conclusion
This README provides a high-level overview of creating a movie recommendation engine using TF-IDF and KNN. Remember to experiment with different hyperparameters, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics to optimize your recommendation system for your specific dataset and use case.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository for a step-by-step implementation guide.
